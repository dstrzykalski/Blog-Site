# Blog_Site

This is my 4th Challenge for the Coding Bootcamp in which I was tasked with creating a blog.
The project contains css html and js code to make the site function.

## Project Structure

The structure of the submitted files is as follows.

1. `index.html`: Serves as the landing page and the form page.
2. `css/`: Contains css files used to style the website.
3. `js/`: Contains the js code that provides functionality.

The js and css files can be found in their respective folders as outlined in the requirements

## Challenges

As it stands the light/dark mode toggle isnt working and i cant seem to figure why.
Also I would like to improve the css formatting but cant quite get things exactly as id like.
